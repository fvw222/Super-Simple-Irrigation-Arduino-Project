Note: I am a beginner in electronics. But this worked very well for me. Hopefully it helps you!
I included the instructions for a project that I used as inspiration for this project.

You will need:
-2 5V pumps DC
-a power module like Elegoo 545043
- M-M DuPont wires
- L293D IC
-bucket
-tubes that fit on the pump outlet nozzle
-some sort of lid for the bucket. 

I built the project on a breadboard. Make sure to use a power unit because you can damage your 
Arduino if you power a DC motor directly from it. Wire the bread board as shown in the diagram 
and attach the pumps so that they dangle below the board. I used some tape to reduce the load 
on the connections. Upload the script to the Arduino and attach the tubes to the output nozzle
of the pumps. Fill a bucket with water and put some holes in the lid (I used a piece of 
cardboard as a lid) to allow the pumps to hang below the lid when the Arduino and breadboard 
are placed on top. Put the tubes where you want the water to go and power up the Arduino. 
Sit back and enjoy life with your newly found time!
